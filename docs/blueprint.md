## Style Guidelines:

- Primary brand color: A deep and authoritative Navy Blue (#0F2757), evoking trust and academic seriousness, used for navigation, headings, and key elements. The primary background color of the body is a very light, desaturated blue-gray (#F0F2F4), creating an open and clean aesthetic that harmonizes with the navy blue, complemented by pure white for main content areas.
- Accent color: A vibrant Light Cyan-Blue (#85D1E0) used for interactive elements, highlights, and subtle calls to action, providing a refreshing contrast against the primary navy and light backgrounds.
- Headline font: 'Alegreya' (serif) to convey an elegant, intellectual, and contemporary feel. Body text font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) chosen for its modern, clean, and warm readability, suitable for longer paragraphs such as campus life descriptions.
- Use sleek, minimalist icons for social media links and other functional elements to maintain a modern and professional visual language consistent with the school's brand. Iconography should subtly complement the primary color palette.
- The layout features a sticky top navigation bar and a fixed footer, ensuring constant access to key information. Content areas are centrally aligned and feature ample white space to enhance readability, with a responsive design adapted for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Subtle, fluid transitions on navigation link hovers and clicks to provide a polished and responsive user experience. Light parallax effects on homepage background imagery or scroll-triggered fades for content sections could enhance visual engagement.
